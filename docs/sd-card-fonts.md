# SD Card Fonts

CrossPoint supports loading additional fonts from the SD card, including fonts
with extended Unicode coverage (CJK, Cyrillic, Greek, etc.).

## Installing Fonts

There are three ways to install fonts:

### Option 1: Download from device (recommended)

1. Connect your CrossPoint reader to Wi-Fi
2. Go to **Settings > Reader > Manage Fonts**
3. Browse available font families and tap to download
4. A single download selects that family and opens **Text Settings** for
   preview. **Download All** prefers `NotoSansSC` (or the first valid catalog
   family when it is absent); **Update All** keeps the current selection.
5. Preview any family or size you want. Leaving **Text Settings** caches only
   the final SD font and size in internal Flash. The preprocessing page appears
   because a download marks the selected font as changed; ordinary layout or
   style edits do not trigger it.

### Option 2: Upload via web browser

1. Start **File Transfer** and connect through **Join Network** or **Create Hotspot**
2. Open the web interface URL shown on the reader
3. Navigate to the **Fonts** tab
4. Upload `.cpfont` files using the upload form

### Option 3: Manual SD card copy

1. Download font files from the
   [crosspoint-fonts repository](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-fonts)
2. Copy font family folders to one of two locations on your SD card:

   - `/.fonts/` — hidden directory (preferred; keeps the SD root tidy
     when mounted on a desktop)
   - `/fonts/` — visible directory (use this if your OS hides dot-files
     and you'd rather see the folder in your file manager)

   Both roots are always scanned at boot and the results are merged: a
   family installed in `/fonts/` shows up even when `/.fonts/` also
   exists, and vice versa. The two roots only collide if the same family
   name appears in both — in that case the copy in `/.fonts/` wins and
   the duplicate in `/fonts/` is ignored.

       SD Card Root/
       ├── .fonts/                     ← Hidden root (preferred)
       │   └── Literata/
       │       ├── Literata_12.cpfont
       │       ├── Literata_14.cpfont
       │       ├── Literata_16.cpfont
       │       └── Literata_18.cpfont
       └── fonts/                      ← Visible root (equally valid)
           └── Merriweather/
               ├── Merriweather_12.cpfont
               └── ...

3. Insert the SD card and power on your CrossPoint reader

## CJK in the User Interface

In global builds the built-in UI fonts are Latin-only, so by default the
interface (book titles in the library, file names in the browser, list rows,
headers) shows replacement boxes for Chinese/Japanese/Korean text even when
book *content* renders correctly with a selected SD-card font.

To avoid shipping a large CJK glyph set in flash, CrossPoint instead reuses the
SD-card font you already selected: when a UI string contains a CJK character
the built-in font cannot draw, that whole string is rendered with your selected
SD-card font instead.

The fallback is **size-matched**. The built-in UI fonts render at 8 pt
(small/author lines), 10 pt (list rows) and 12 pt (book-cover titles, headers),
so CrossPoint loads your SD family at those sizes too and maps each UI font to
its same-size SD font. CJK book names therefore appear at the same size as the
Latin text around them. For this to work the family must contain `.cpfont`
files at sizes **8, 10 and 12** (in addition to the reader sizes 12–18); any UI
size missing from the family simply keeps showing boxes for CJK at that size.
The extra sizes are not loaded when the built-in UI fonts already cover every
CJK script detected in the selected family.

The Simplified-Chinese firmware is intentionally different: its embedded
8/10/12pt UI fonts already cover the supported interface, so it does not keep
the three SD fallback sizes resident. The selected reader-size SD font still
renders book content normally. Japanese/Korean UI glyphs outside the embedded
set may therefore show replacement boxes in that build; preserving contiguous
heap for EPUB decoding takes priority on the ESP32-C3.

Note that **Settings > Reader > Font Size** lists every size the family ships,
so a family built at 8,10,12,14,16,18 offers all six as reading sizes — the UI
sizes are not hidden from the list. Reading at 8 pt is your call; if you would
rather not see the small sizes there, convert two families (one with the UI
sizes for fallback, one with only the reading sizes you want).

When converting your own font, include the UI sizes:

    python3 lib/EpdFont/scripts/fontconvert_sdcard.py \
      MyCJKFont-Regular.otf \
      --intervals cjk \
      --sizes 8,10,12,14,16,18 \
      --style regular \
      --name MyCJKFont \
      --output-dir ./MyCJKFont/

What this means in practice:

- Select a CJK-capable SD font under **Settings > Reader > Font Family**
  (see [Installing Fonts](#installing-fonts) and the `cjk` / `hangul` presets
  under [Converting Custom Fonts](#converting-custom-fonts)). That single
  selection drives both book content *and* size-matched CJK fallback in the UI.
- Pure-Latin UI strings keep the crisp built-in font; only strings that
  actually contain CJK are routed to the SD font.
- The fallback is per *string*, not per glyph: a mixed title such as
  `三体 Vol.1` renders entirely in the SD font (including the Latin part). If
  that SD font is a `Mono` family, the Latin portion will appear half/full
  width.
- If no SD font is selected (a built-in reading font is active), there is no
  CJK fallback and the UI again shows boxes for CJK — pick a CJK SD font to
  restore it.

## Available Pre-Built Fonts

The current list of pre-built fonts is maintained in the
[crosspoint-fonts repository](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-fonts).

Current Chinese firmware loads its manifest through the CrossMux API, and the
manifest points immutable font files at `assets.crossmux.cn`. Older Chinese
firmware still loads the Gitee release manifest; that manifest points to the
same assets domain, so those devices do not follow Gitee redirects for each
font file. Global builds continue to use the GitHub manifest and assets.

The CrossMux `/api/assets/fonts/m1-b4/<file>.cpfont` Gitee proxy remains a
compatibility and rollback path. It is not the canonical file source.

The Chinese and global catalogs both publish manifest v1 with a valid
`baseUrl`, family/file names, non-zero file sizes, and CRC32 values. Every
referenced asset must be cpfont v4 and provide the coverage promised by its
catalog maintainer. Font sources and catalog-generation configuration are not
kept in this repository.

In a Chinese EPUB, confirming the incomplete-font prompt starts an automatic
reader-only flow: connect Wi-Fi, download and verify the complete `NotoSansSC`
family, and save the exact current point size. It then silently restarts before
loading the font, avoiding the fragmented heap left by Wi-Fi/TLS, and preprocesses
that size on the clean boot before returning to the same book and visible text
position. Page numbers can change because the new font repaginates the book. Back
or Wi-Fi cancellation returns to the book without changing the selection, while
Home always returns to Home. Download or clean-boot font-load errors offer Retry
and Back. A preprocessing failure keeps the verified SD font, disables Flash
acceleration, and returns after one notice.

The manual font manager and the prompt opened from Text Settings keep the
interactive preview flow described above.

## Converting Custom Fonts

To convert your own TrueType/OpenType fonts:

### Prerequisites

    pip install freetype-py fonttools

### Single font (one style)

    python3 lib/EpdFont/scripts/fontconvert_sdcard.py \
      MyFont-Regular.ttf \
      --intervals latin-ext \
      --sizes 12,14,16,18 \
      --style regular \
      --name MyFont \
      --output-dir ./MyFont/

### Multi-style font

    python3 lib/EpdFont/scripts/fontconvert_sdcard.py \
      --regular MyFont-Regular.ttf \
      --bold MyFont-Bold.ttf \
      --italic MyFont-Italic.ttf \
      --bolditalic MyFont-BoldItalic.ttf \
      --intervals latin-ext \
      --sizes 12,14,16,18 \
      --name MyFont \
      --output-dir ./MyFont/

**Text Settings > Style > Synthetic Bold** replaces EPUB bold faces with the
regular or italic face thickened by one (Standard) or two (Heavy) horizontal
pixels at render time. It does not change font metrics, wrapping, or the
`.cpfont` format, and it does not affect menus or status-bar text. Standard is
the default for newly initialized settings; an existing saved choice is kept.

Combine presets with commas: `--intervals latin-ext,greek,cyrillic`

You can also specify arbitrary Unicode ranges directly:
`--intervals latin-ext,(0x2100-0x214F)`

To list all presets with codepoint counts:

    python3 lib/EpdFont/scripts/fontconvert_sdcard.py --list-presets

### Additional options

`--force-autohint` — force FreeType's auto-hinter instead of the font's native hinting (useful when a font's built-in hints produce poor results at small sizes).

Install custom fonts via the web interface or manual SD card copy.
